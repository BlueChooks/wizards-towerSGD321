            <p>You drink the bottle of <scribbles->levitation potion</scribbles-> and instantly start floating upward. With some frantic arm-flapping and scrabbling at the walls, you manage to manoeuvre your way onto the second-floor landing just before gravity reasserts itself.</p>
            <p>Taking some rope from your bag, you tie it around a sturdy-looking torch-sconce and throw the length of it down the ruined stairs. You should have a much easier time getting up and down now.</p>
            <p>Congratulations! You have completed the playable part of the Wizard's Tower pre-alpha release. Thanks for playing!</p>
