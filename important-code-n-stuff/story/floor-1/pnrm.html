            <p>You are in the Potion Room.</p>

            <p>This room is full of strange smells. The walls are lined with shelves full of bottles, most of which are empty, although some seem to have some sort of gunk congealed on the bottom - probably what's left of whatever potions they once contained.</p>

            <p>The tables, floor, and even the walls are covered in multi-coloured stains, which seem to be mostly concentrated around a <a href="cauldron.html">cauldron</a> on a table to your left. Next to the cauldron is a large <a href="rbook-contents.html">book</a> with 'Recipes' scrawled across the front. To your right is a <a href="cabinet.html">cabinet</a> of many small drawers.</p>
