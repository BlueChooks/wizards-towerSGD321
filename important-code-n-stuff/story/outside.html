                <p>You've finally found it! The tower of Araxus the Arcane, lost over a hundred years ago when Araxus himself mysteriously disappeared.</p>
                <p>Araxus' immense power was rivalled only by his profound wisdom. It was he who repelled the undead horde when it emerged from the Dark Forest, who brokered peace between the warring nations of Irod <!-- whose people are the Irodeshi --> and Ar-Shadeth, and who cured the Blood Pox that nearly destroyed Springbarrow. So loved and respected was he that festivals are still held in his honour to this day.</p>
