            <!-- <p>You take one step forward ...</p>
            <p>With a yowl, a cat the size of a horse pounces at you from behind some crates. It is grossly mutated, with seemingly random features swollen to obscene sizes. Its fur is thin and patchy, its skin thin enough to make every rib visible.</p>
            <p>It has a wild desperation in its eyes. You get the impression that you're the first meal it has seen in decades.</p> -->
            <p>You fill the bowl with sleep potion and step back.</p>
            <p>After a moment, you hear a snuffling, and a horrifically mutated cat the size of a horse appears from behind a group of crates. It sniffs at the bowl for a moment, then starts to sway on its feet. Then it sneezes, shaking off the effect and fixing its eyes on you.</p>
            <p>It looks like the cat isn't interested in the sleep potion alone. You'll need something to convince it to drink more.</p>
