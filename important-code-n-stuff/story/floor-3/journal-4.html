            <p class="doc araxus-handwriting">They all want my gem. The people, the king, the Wizard's Guild, Mother - I can see it in their eyes. Every time I go out in public I can see them looking at it. They want to take it from me. They'll kill me and take my gem.</p>
            <p class="doc araxus-handwriting">They can't have it. The gem is everything. It's mine.</p>
            <p class="doc araxus-handwriting">I have to hide it. I made a new floor on the tower, hid the ladder. Got a cat to guard it. Made it better with magic. Still gets distracted by catnip, though. Have to fix that.</p>
            <p class="doc araxus-handwriting">It's my gem. They won't get it.</p>
