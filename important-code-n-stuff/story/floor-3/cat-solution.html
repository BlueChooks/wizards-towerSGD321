            <!-- <p>You take one step forward ...</p>
            <p>With a yowl, a cat the size of a horse pounces at you from behind some crates. It is grossly mutated, with seemingly random features swollen to obscene sizes. Its fur is thin and patchy, its skin thin enough to make every rib visible.</p>
            <p>It has a wild desperation in its eyes. You get the impression that you're the first meal it has seen in decades.</p> -->
            <p>You fill the bowl with catnip, sprinkle on some sleep potion, and step back.</p>
            <p>After a moment, you hear a snuffling, and a horrifically mutated cat the size of a horse appears from behind a group of crates. It doesn't seem to notice you as it stalks toward the bowl.</p>
            <p>It sniffs the bowl for a moment, then starts to nibble on the catnip. After a few seconds of enthusiastic munching, the creature's head starts nodding. It sways on its feet, its eyes drift closed, then it collapses in a snoring heap.</p>
            <p>The path to the <a href="../floor-4/hub4.html">ladder</a> is clear.</p>
