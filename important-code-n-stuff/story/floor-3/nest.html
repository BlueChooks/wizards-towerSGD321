            <p>A pile of dust-covered blankets is nestled in the corner, sectioned off from the rest of the room by a low wall of barrels. A <a href="journal-4.html">journal</a> rests on top of one barrel.</p>
            <p>A long stick lays discarded on the floor. It's wrapped with intricate curls of tarnished copper wire, and seems to have once been painted in bright purple and gold. At one end, the intricate curls of wire become a mass of tangles and loose ends, as though something they once affixed to the stick had been forcibly removed.</p>
