            <p>With a yowl, a cat the size of a horse pounces at you from behind some crates. It is grossly mutated, with seemingly random features swollen to obscene sizes. Its fur is thin and patchy, its skin thin enough to make every rib visible.</p>
            <p>It has a wild desperation in its eyes. You get the impression that you're the first meal it has seen in decades.</p>
