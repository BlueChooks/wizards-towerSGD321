            <!-- <p>You take one step forward ...</p>
            <p>With a yowl, a cat the size of a horse pounces at you from behind some crates. It is grossly mutated, with seemingly random features swollen to obscene sizes. Its fur is thin and patchy, its skin thin enough to make every rib visible.</p>
            <p>It has a wild desperation in its eyes. You get the impression that you're the first meal it has seen in decades.</p> -->
            <p>You place a handful of catnip in the bowl and step back.</p>
            <p>After a moment, you hear a snuffling, and a horrifically mutated cat the size of a horse appears from behind a group of crates. It doesn't seem to notice you as it stalks toward the bowl and starts nibbling on the catnip.</p>
            <p>You start carefully inching your way past it, but suddenly its head snaps up and it locks eyes with you. With a yowl, it swipes at you with its claws, just barely missing you.</p>
            <p>It looks like the catnip alone isn't enough to distract the creature. You'll need to add something else to keep it from noticing you.</p>
