            <p>The journal entry reads:</p>
            <p class="doc araxus-handwriting">The Blood Pox is gone, thanks to my excellent alchemy, and most of the town survived. But people will know I had it by the scars it left on my face, and I can't grow enough of a beard to hide them. Maybe I should stay out of the public eye for a while - if people knew that the plague only affected people without inherent magic, they would think I'm a fraud!</p>
            <p class="doc araxus-handwriting">In fact, I think I should definitely take some time away from the people. They're getting far too interested in my gem. I've mounted it on a long stick like a real wizard's staff, but people keep looking at it whenever I'm out in public, and I've even seen people wandering around the base of the tower when I'm at home. Sooner or later, they're going to try and take it. I can't let it out of my sight - I've started sleeping in my study, just to make it harder for someone to sneak in and out and take it in the night.</p>
            <p class="doc araxus-handwriting">Maybe I can hide the tower with magic? Or even move it somewhere secret, away from town. Surely I have the power to do that now.</p>
