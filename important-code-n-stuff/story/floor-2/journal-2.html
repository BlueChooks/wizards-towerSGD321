            <p>The journal entry reads:</p>
            <p class="doc araxus-handwriting">The Dark Forest had the answer! I was collecting ingredients when I was overcome with the knowledge that what I sought was within reach - just a little deeper in. Such is my great intuition that only half an hour's walk proved me correct.</p>
            <p class="doc araxus-handwriting">A group of creatures were sitting on the ground at the forest's centre, staring at a gem as big as my fist and glowing like a torch. Maybe they were human - it was hard to tell through all the filth, as if they'd done nothing but dig in the mud their whole lives. The one holding the gem barely reacted when I took it out of his hands - just sort of turned to look at me.</p>
            <p class="doc araxus-handwriting">But this gem! I could feel the magic in it. I've never seen anything so powerful, and I know all about powerful magical objects. So I took it and left - I didn't want to stay near those <del>creepy</del> disgusting creatures any longer than I had to.</p>
            <p class="doc araxus-handwriting">They turned out to be sneaky, though, and followed me out of the forest. I was on my way home, going to stop by the apothecary in town when I heard screams behind me. Dozens of the creatures were running through the street right toward me! Trying to take back my gem, no doubt. People were running and screaming all around me, but I have the instincts of a lion. I let out a mighty roar, held the gem up before me, and lightning shot out of it to disintegrate all of the creatures in one blast! I always knew I was a magical prodigy, able to instinctually bend this mighty artefact to my will, after only an hour or so!</p>
            <p class="doc araxus-handwriting">I thought it prudent to leave quickly after that.</p>
            <p class="doc araxus-handwriting">But this gem is the power I've been searching for. It means I can leave behind my life of mediocrity for one of fame and fortune! The Wizard's Guild cannot ignore me any longer! I will have my seat on their council!</p>
