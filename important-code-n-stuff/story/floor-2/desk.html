            <p>The desk is large and heavy, built of beautiful dark mahogany wood. Unlike the furniture in the potions room downstairs, its surface is clean, if somewhat cluttered. Perhaps it was new, or it saw less use than the furniture downstairs? Loose sheets of paper are strewn across it, covered in unintelligible equations, diagrams, and sketches of what looks to be a jagged rock. A few books are amongst the clutter, with titles like 'A Novice's Guide to Wizardry' and 'The Foundations of Magic'.</p>
            <p>Poking out from beneath a book is a letter that reads:</p>
            <p class="doc mum-handwriting">I've been hearing some interesting news about an up-and-coming new wizard in Little Glenville who's been doing some amazing things. I'm proud of you, dear, and I'm glad you've found a way to follow your dreams. It would have been nice to hear it from you, rather than from town gossip, but from the sounds of things, you've been too busy to write to your dear old Mum, so I won't be too upset.</p>
            <p class="doc mum-handwriting">Now, I know you don't think much of your name, my dear Boris, but the Fishbringers have been respected in the alchemy community for generations and I wish you wouldn't abandon that legacy. 'Araxus the Arcane' was funny when you played pretend as a child, but it's a bit pretentious for an adult, don't you think?</p>
            <p class="doc mum-handwriting">Don't forget your alchemist roots, my dear. Even with your new fame and power, you can still do more good in the world with medicine than with fireworks. And besides, the endorsement of such a mighty wizard as Araxus the Arcane might bring some wider respect to our underappreciated craft.</p>
            <p class="doc mum-handwriting">Much love,</p>
            <p class="doc mum-handwriting">Mum</p>
