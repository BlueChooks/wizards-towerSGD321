            <p class="doc mum-handwriting">Hi Dear,</p>
            <p class="doc mum-handwriting">I'm afraid I'm not familiar with the Blood Pox you described in your last letter, but I asked Julie at the hairdresser's - she always seems to know a little bit about everything. She has a friend who knows a wizard who knows another wizard who knows a story about something similar.</p>
            <p class="doc mum-handwriting">It turns out, if people who aren't used to magic are suddenly exposed to a lot of it all the time, it can have some nasty effects. The rash will spread if left untreated, and can cause permanent numbness in affected areas. Definitely <u>DO NOT</u> let it spread to the eyes or ears.</p>
            <p class="doc mum-handwriting">Julie didn't know the recipe for the ointment, but by my best guess, it will need one part toadstool caps to two parts dagger-grass. Add about three drops of fig oil per toadstool and steep for at least three days before adding as many <u>fresh</u> steeltwig leaves as your cauldron can fit. Careful of the thorns when harvesting them.</p>
            <p class="doc mum-handwriting">Are you okay, dear? I'm planning to come and visit once the flu season is done and I'm not needed so badly here, but if you're sick, I'll drop everything and come take care of you - just let me know. Either way, maybe take it easy on the fireworks in town for a while. For your own health, as well as other people's.</p>
            <p class="doc mum-handwriting">Your loving Mum</p>
