            <p>Three tapestries hang on the wall. They're all faded and moth-eaten, but you can just about make them out if you look closely.</p>
            <p>They each depict the same wizard in various grandiose poses. In one, his raised staff is struck by lightning, or perhaps he is shooting the lightning skyward. In another, he stands amidst burning houses, arms outstretched as great waves of water rise up from behind him, poised to crash down on the flames. In the last, he is surrounded by children, all with mottled grey and red skin except for the one whose head he is touching, a bright light emanating from the point of contact.</p>
            <p>In each tapestry, the wizard's staff features prominently: a length of twisted wood with something large and glowing at one end.</p>
