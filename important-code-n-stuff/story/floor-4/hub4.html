            <p>The top-most floor is dark. There are no windows or cracks in the stone to let in daylight.

While the light doesn't do much to illuminate your surroundings, it does reveal patches of <a href="walls.html">writing on the walls</a>.<!-- Only the light from the glowing gem in the centre of the room penetrates the darkness, throwing weird and ominous shadows across the walls. --></p>
            <!-- <p>The figure's back is to you, and whatever it cradles in its lap is shining beams of light from between its fingers. The light does little to illuminate the room, but it does reveal patches of <a>writing on the walls</a>.</p> -->
