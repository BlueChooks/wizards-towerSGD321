            <p>You carefully prize the crystal out of the figure's hands. It's warm to the touch and thrums with an unfamiliar energy. It feels <i>right</i> in your hands, like it has always belonged to you.</p>
            <p>A tiny sound makes you glance up. The figure's once-dull eyes have become bright, their gaze fixed to yours. They follow you as you stumble back, startled, and continue following you as you rise and move slowly toward the <a href="end.html">ladder</a>.</p>
