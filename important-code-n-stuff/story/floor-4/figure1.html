            <p>The figure's back is to you, hunching forward over something that glows brightly. Its clothes are ragged, coated with dust and mold, but just enough intricate lacework remains to indicate that they were once very fine.</p>
            <p>It doesn't react as you circle around to its front, only stares unblinkingly at the object cradled in its lap. From this angle, you can see that its skin is grey, its eyes sunken and dull, its hair and beard long and patchy. Whatever humanity it once had seems to have gone, leaving an empty husk.</p>
            <!-- <p>The figure's back is to you, and whatever it cradles in its lap is shining beams of light from between its fingers. The light does little to illuminate the room, but it does reveal patches of <a>writing on the walls</a>.</p> -->
